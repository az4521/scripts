#### [Lucky 1.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upnextfm/scripts/master/lucky.js)
Creates a `/lucky` command, which searches YouTube using the query following the command, and queues the first video found.

#### [Macros 1.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/upnextfm/scripts/master/macros.js)
Gives users the option to create macros, or "shortcuts" for long messages.

Once the script is installed go to Options -> Macros to define and edit macros. Macros have two parts: a trigger
and a replacement. An example trigger is `"@fire@"` with the replacement `":fire: :fire: :fire:"`. Once
the macro has been added you can type it into the chat box (e.g. `"@fire@"`) and it will be replaced
by the replacement.

Macros also allow for simple variable interpolation. As an example, you can create a macro with the trigger
`"@which {first} {second}@"` and the replacement `"Choose one: {first} or {second}"`. To use
the macro, type `"@which cake pie@"` into the chat box, and it will be replaced with `"Choose one: cake or pie"`.
